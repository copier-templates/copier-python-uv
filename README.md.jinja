## Notes

This project was generated using the copier template. To refresh with upstream improvements later run:
```bash
copier update
```
Do not manually edit the `.copier-answers.yml` file (it is auto-maintained by Copier).

To re-create this project non-interactively from the template in a new location you can prepare a data file with the needed keys and run:
```bash
copier copy --data-file path/to/data.yml /path/to/template /new/dest
```
